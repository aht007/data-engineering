&#x200B;

I drive a Rivian R1S and live in Texas, more specifically, Houston, ‚Äúoil country.‚Äù I just had my 5th person tell me how dirty the process of making electric cars, blah blah blah‚Ä¶.. so I told him:

‚ÄúLook, the ‚Äòclean energy‚Äô aspect is like 7 on the list of why I got this. I got it cause it can survive the rubicon trail and smoke a Lamborghini urus and mid level Ferrari while my kids wave to the driver in their car seats in the third row‚Ä¶. And all for under $100k‚Äù

&#x200B;

Can we all admit that, for many of us, the reason for purchasing an electric car has changed? It's no longer purchased exclusively by people who care about green energy or environmental issues. We can now purchase a vehicle that moves our kids comfortably and has the performance of an elite sports car, and way more storage.... and I charge it for less than what I filled up my first car for in the 90's. All in all, we buy them cause they're just awesome cars. Period.  

I know there are many people who just want to spew the garbage they hear on their favorite ""news"" show, but I've found changing the way I discuss it with many has at least made them silent if not changed their opinion at least slightly.... especially when they get in my car and I floor it üòâ.",2024-01-17 17:25:42,837

electric vehicle,electricvehicles,Why Electric Vehicle Registration Fees are the Wrong Solution,0ne_Wheel_Man,"* Currently: 33 states require an annual flat registration fee for electric vehicles (with other states in the process of creating them).
* This is harmful as it punishes drivers who travel fewer miles and who drive smaller more efficient vehicles.
* It can result in ridiculous discrepancies (someone who drives a Chevy Bolt 5,000 miles a year pays the same as someone who drive a Hummer EV 40,000 miles a year.  Someone who drives 15,000 miles a year in Texas with an EV pays the same as someone driving a 15mpg gas vehicle the same distance.
* I am NOT saying that EV's should pay no road tax.  The solution is one that considers either miles traveled, power consumed, or a combination.   For example:  If we took Annual mileage/(mpge/3)\*(state gas tax), then a 70mpge ford F150 lightning would pay about the same gas tax as a 23mpg 2.7 Liter V6 gas version.  A 100mpge vehicle would pay the same tax as a 33mpg gas vehicle, etc.  (The exact numbers could be adjusted, but this is just an example of something that would be significantly better than the one size fits all flat fee)

If anyone is interested, I actually made a spread sheet that shows the gas tax and EV registration fees (for all states that have them, +PA with their proposed future fees).  I include mpg equivalent you're paying gas tax to in that state based on how far you drive in a year, and include some example gas vehicles showing how many miles they'd have to travel before the gas tax they pay is equal to the EV registration fee (for example, in Texas a 2024 prius would have to go 57,000 miles in a year to pay gas tax equal to the EV registration fee)

Note: the spreadsheet is still a work in progress and I have not yet included any hybrid fees (as those are often different, but I plan to include this in the future).

Here is a screenshot of the spreadsheet in progress:  
[https://i.postimg.cc/5tTXZfxq/spreadsheet-screenshot.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/5tTXZfxq/spreadsheet-screenshot.jpg)

Notes: Most of it is alphabetical with 3 exceptions.  New Jersey at the top has the highest set EV registration fee ($250).  Texas has the highest discrepancy where EV's pay the most in proportion to gas vehicles compared to any other state) and Pennsylvania, which has no registration fee in 2024, but voted to pass one if the governor signs it into law (starting at $200, then moving to $250, then is allowed to increase every year 2027 onwards) so they'll be tied for the highest EV registration fee in 2026.  Again, I haven't included hybrids yet, and am open to suggestions.

  
EDIT:

Naturally I decided to go and try out some. I'm a I suppose soft car enthusiast; I love cars, I love driving, but I don't need a manual diesel with cloth seats and roll down windows to enjoy myself. So these reviews will be from that perspective, and trying to view it from the target audience

If you want to fight in the comments about how my takes are trash quickly, here is a tdlr:

Most Suprising (positive): Ford F150 Lightning

Most Suprising (negative): Hyundai Ioniq 5

Best Value: Tesla Model 3 Standard Range (Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y Standard Range

With that out of the way, let's get started, in no particular order:

1: Cadillac Lyriq: 7/10

This car feels like a classic Cadillac, for good and for ill. Everything about it is smooth, and it feels refined while putting its power down, not powerful but enough for what it is. Nothing particularly special in terms of charging or range, but I feel it fits the Cadillac clientel very well; lot's of room in the back and up front, touchscreen and cameras were good. UI was also very good, if a bit menu filled

It's downsides are, well, classically Cadillac. The interior was *okay*. The sound system was *okay*. But given the car's sticker said it was nearly *$91,000 CAD before tax* it shouldn't be *okay*. It should be at the tier of the Germans, and it still just... isn't. I wouldn't be as offended if it was significantly less pricey than something like the new Q6 or EQE SUV, but it isn't. Especially after the Neue Klasse iX3 gets here, they'll need to cut prices imo

2: Chevrolet Blazer: 4/10

Buy an Equinox. Or buy a Lyriq if you have the cash. This car feels like a worse version of both at the same time, and I'm not sure why. Chevy for some reason seems to not quite have 1 pedal driving down as well as Cadillac does, and while I could forgive this for the Equinox to an extent, it somehow feels worse in the Blazer. Likewise, the interior is a major downgrade from the Lyriq but not *really* an upgrade over the Equinox. There's stiching on the doors, but it's all softish plastic, not even fake leather. Dash feels very similar, as do the buttons to the Equinox. I'd say it's like \~10% nicer, and you get a HUD and a slightly larger vehicle than the Equinox. But if you want that, stretch for the Lyriq or get a slightly used one for the same price.

My first thought given the RS badge was that this would be the ""sporty"" one, but no. Zero steering feel, poor pedal feel, numb acceleration. I could forgive it, but given there's better options that GM makes, I think they just messed this one up

Oh, and normal door handles. The Blazer has that while the Equinox and Lyriq have the the pop out door handles. I have no idea why. It feels like they had a bunch of ICE Blazer door handles and want to use them up

3: Ford F-150 Lightning: 8/10

Now, to start; I am not a Truck guy. I don't have any use for one. No one in my family owns one. So keep that in mind for this review

But I gotta say, I was really blown away by the F-150 Lightning. It's a huge truck, but it really doesn't FEEL that way. The steering is good, manuverability is great, far better than you'd think for such a beast. Honestly, other than the massive tires reminding me, it felt like I was driving a midsized SUV, not a full sized truck

If you don't tow far or often, and you want a full sized, Ford is offering a whole bunch of cash on the hood. And it feels like a normal Ford! Physical gear shifter, same sort of seating, same UI. A bit meh UI, but it's very user friendly. I was genuinely shocked at how much I enjoyed it

It solves the two major issues imo of a full sized ICE truck; fuel economy and driving feel. If you can get a deal and want a truck; jump on it. Just be aware that this is very much a gen 1 product and won't hold value

4: Hyundai Ioniq 5: 8.5/10

You know that saying that a heretic is worse than a heathen? That's my experience with the Ioniq 5. It's *so close* to being a 10/10, but there's a few ergonomic issues that just really kill it

It has great one pedal driving, imo tied for 2nd with Tesla, slightly behind Volvo. Great charging speed, suprisingly fun handling given its an SUV. Read the reviews; it's great, everyone says it is, and I agree with them

*However*; 3 major issues that I found. First; the steering wheel obscures the gauge cluster unless you put it up unnaturally high. Second, the seat. I couldn't really find a comfy seating position; even with the seat all the way down, I felt like my head was almost touching the roof, and I'm not even that tall at \~6'1. Third, the bezels around the infotainment are absurdly large. It feels like an old timey TV with the massive box around them

Now, most of this is apparently fixed in the 2025 model year refresh. But it's just frustrating becasue even with the Ioniq 6 which I saw there, the bezel issue wasn't as bad. They know it's bad clearly! But it took awhile to fix. If you don't mind these things, then this is imo the best value. But I can't get over it

5: Tesla Model Y SR: 6/10

This is another similar casualty to the Blazer and the Ioniq 5. It's not AWFUL; although I find the interior to be pretty bad for the price. But the Model 3 highland fixes all the issues I have with the current Model Y, and it does it while being cheaper. I'd really, *strongly* recommend waiting until whatever the Model Y update

Drivetrain wise, pretty good! Tesla has good one pedal driving, like I said previously. It just falls apart with the interior quality. I found that the fake wood (or maybe real?) just felt really bad to the touch. I had a hard time adjusting the air vents in a pleasing way, which was annoying. The seats were just very uncomfortable, the merged headrest felt awful after awhile. Maybe if it was an economy car, whatever. But given the only configuration available for purchase new is the LR at \~$60,000 CAD, I expect better

Otherwise, I think it's... okay. For the price it was useable when the only competition it really has was the ID.4 and nearly impossible to get models like the Ioniq 5. But now supply has caught up, new models exist, and like I said; I *know* that Tesla can do better because they do! They have a great product in the form of the Model 3 Highland!

6: Chevrolet Equinox: 9/10

Chevy has a hit in the making if they can just market it well. This car will be my next vehicle.

Now that my cards are on the table, I will offer some criticism. The UI works fine, concerns there are overblown. But it's just a bit slow. Not the WORST (looking at you Volvo) by any means, but something that's disappointing. 1PD isn't super smooth, but it's less bad than the Blazer

Otherwise, I'll just say that this car provides value. Good range, okay charging speeds, but good enough. This is the car of close enough; everything except range isn't really class leading, but for the price and all together makes a great package

My biggest complaint? I'd like to denounce the Chevy exec who gave this thing 21 inch rims. It looks ridiculous, like a child wearing their father's shoes. But hey, maybe there were people who said ""yes, I'd love worse ride quality and worse fuel economy"". Maybe there are! If so, I'll apologize; you're a victim too

I honestly want to try and hypermile this. I genuinely think if I knocked this thing down to 19 or 18', I could hit the high 550s

7: Tesla Model 3 SR (Highland): 9/10

Tesla is the Apple of cars; you love it or you don't, but you have some sort of feeling about it one way or another. But if you're a spiritual Android user, if you can swallow your dislike, there's a LOT to like here

Every material issue I have with the model Y is basically solved. Better materials, better comfort, it feels quieter. Already very great UI is somehow even faster and better. For under $50k CAD, the RWD Standard range provides a whole bunch of value. \~440 km of range, good charging, access to the Tesla network (obviously), ventilated seats... again, 90% of my issue with it comes down to the monoscreen. I Just Don't Like It. It's not an issue for driving, but I don't find it aesthetically pleasing

But like I said; tonnes of value here if you like it or don't care about the layout.

8: BMW i4 M50: 10/10

You ever hear the phrase ""Jack of all trades, master of none. But better the Jack, than a master of one""? That is the BMW i4 to a tee. Nothing really crazy; even in terms of HP, there's faster cars out there. But my god does it come together in a fundamentally great package. The owner of this car was an enthusiasts, so he encouraged me to really give this the gas (or whatever) and it was great. He took over for awhile and REALLY gave it, and imo you could feel the weight around 9/10ths - but frankly, I don't think I'd ever get it there with any regularity, so the remaining 8/10ths are great

The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is that it's pricey. My man had literally every possible option, down to the full leather seats, and the special paint. He said it was near 100k all in all. Now he also mentioned offhandedly that his wife sat in and loved the new iX and so they bought it when he went to pick his new i4 up a few years back, so I assume he's good for money, but still. Damn pricey

After a few years of BMW depreciation though? Madon, fantastic used vehicle

9: Nissan Ariya: 6/10

Who is this for?

In theory, the Ariya isn't a bad vehicle. It's rather nice actually; comfortable interior, very smooth powertrain, nice touchpoints. Very roomy! It feels like a much larger vehicle than it is

My issue with it was that its top trim is nearly $*65,000 CAD*. And it used to be more! They simplified the 25 trim differences, and that used to hit the 70s! The small battery option is in the mid 50s, and then it gets progressively more expensive. What justifies that? No super fast charging like the Ioniq 5, no major range, not really any brand appeal. Nissan seemed to make a Murano equivalent, but I never see Muranos! I see Rogues! They needed a Leaf varient with Rogue styling, and didn't deliver. I saw one for sale today with an advertised $10,000 cash on the hood. That says everything, imo

If it topped out at, say, 60, then I think that'd be fair enough. But even then, I find the local Nissan dealership awful to talk with based on my sister's experience with them, but that's not necessarily Nissan's fault

11: Volvo EX40: 7.5/10

You know the gene some people have that makes Cilantro taste like soap? That's Volvo. You either have the gene that makes you love Volvo, or you don't. I happen to have it, but I'll try and be objective

The powertrain; fantastic. It's smooth, but not in the same way as Hyundai or Tesla with their 1 pedal driving. You feel everything, but it feels fantastic. Steering is tight while driving fast, while instantly becoming very light and manuverable at low speeds. Great sound system even in the ""cheap"" harmen kardon option versus the B&O, and incredibly comfortable seats, as Volvo often does well

The downside is that this is a 40 series, not a 60 series, and it feels like it. Not super plush in terms of touchpoints, the seats are a textile blend. But it still feels nice enough. It's also very clearly a first gen product; it's just an electric XC40. Infotainment system also needs some work; it's slow, menu hell, and just generally a pain

But like I said; it's just so *nice* that I can ignore any flaws. Buy it used or lease it, and wait for the new EX60 to come out",2024-10-08 00:45:45,1253

EV,electricvehicles,I‚Äôm just going to say it: 90% of you aren‚Äôt going to keep your EVs long enough to worry about extending your batteries‚Äô healths this much. ,Rubes27,"Very, very few people keep their cars long enough that anyone should be considerably worried about their battery‚Äôs longevity.

Cars are tools used to enrich aspects of your life. Treat them as such and stop stressing about SoH so much.

Edit: commenters‚Äô reading comprehension is not looking great.

Edit 2: since no one wants to really read I‚Äôll explain it: I bought a used 2019 Leaf S with ~6k miles on it, 40kWh battery. I opportunity charge at home and work, put around 175 miles on it per week. Granted I don‚Äôt really fast charge, but my car isn‚Äôt really designed to do this often like many of ya‚Äôlls cars do. With very little consideration I have managed to go from 100% SoH to 86% (just checked LeafSpy) in four years and 50k miles. I will drive this car in to the ground. If I hit the SoH until it was 50% it would STILL serve my uses. That may be in 7-8 more years from now bringing its total life span to 13 years. This car will have gotten me to work and made me so much money in 13 years I‚Äôll hardly care what a dealer will give me for it. 

Y‚Äôall gotta stop worrying about your batteries so much.",2024-09-12 03:42:15,1308

Original post:

My family and I will likely buy an EV within the next few years. My suggestion's always been to save for a Tesla, but my parents weren't comfortable with the idea of financially supporting Elon Musk.

My view was always that Teslas are worth it regardless, that is, until he's started making suspicious salutes.

Now (among other things), I've definitely come around to their way of thinking (morality wise), but still unsure which alternative to potentially go for when Tesla have such a strong market share, and there are so many options out there.

Long story short, if manufacturers want to take advantage with an intensive marketing/technological push etc, I can't think of a better time than now",2025-01-22 17:43:19,610

Gasoline generators are running out of fuel and getting gas is an issue as gas pumps have been flooded and out of commission.

Natural gas utility connected generators are doing a great job, but in some areas gas utilities have stopped pumping gas through the pipes because the pumping station was flooded or has lost power or has been damaged.

People who have only grid tied solar are at a disadvantage because without the grid, their solar isn't working. 

People with solar + battery backup are having a great time (comparatively) as they still have most functions of their home going on. And are helping out neighbors to charge their phones and devices.

EV,electricvehicles,PSA: Avoid the Chevrolet Blazer EV,dannydomenic,"**I‚Äôm writing this after getting stranded in my 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV for the third time in less than three months.** For context, I bought the Blazer EV on May 11, 2024. The software is fully updated. It has now had a high voltage system failure three separate times. My dealer told me that I‚Äôm not the first customer of theirs that this has happened to.

My Blazer EV was in service for 29 out of my first 45 days of ownership, and will now be back in service again for the same issue.

https://imgur.com/a/JQR7j9D

Notice the difference in mileage between all of these pictures. I took each of these pictures immediately after the error codes popped up.

To make matters worse, I was on a 300 mile road trip for work when the error code popped up yesterday. I was charging at a fast charger and the charging stopped. I luckily had enough charge to make it home at 2% battery. I had to drive home in 100¬∞ heat for an hour and a half with no AC to conserve range because the Blazer EV quit charging unexpectedly.

My Blazer EV is sitting in my garage unable to charge, stuck at 2%. The dealership is getting it towed to them Monday morning and bringing me a loaner.

I asked GM to buy back the car after the second high voltage system issue. I said it was not reliable or safe. GM refused my buy back request before because the car was ‚Äúfixed‚Äù.

Less than a month later I was over 100 miles from home, charging quit unexpectedly, in 100¬∞ heat, and worried if I‚Äôd make it home safely.

All because of the Chevrolet Blazer EV.

**The Chevrolet Blazer EV is a safety hazard.** Avoid the Blazer EV at all costs. GM is a nightmare. They don‚Äôt stand behind their products because their products are terrible.

After this laughably awful experience, I will never buy a GM product again.",2024-08-05 14:14:54,1059

The use of the Google play store to install and use a small number of apps to further enjoy the in car experience is also a nice inclusion. Unfortunately all of these features go away without an OnStar package for data through AT&T. This puts important features like traffic data for Google maps and access to in car apps behind a paywall. The cheapest package is $35 a month and the most expensive package at $52. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be making this post if there was the inclusion of Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. It may go without saying but Tesla charges $10 a month for what they call ‚ÄúPremium Connectivity‚Äù that would include all the features like in car apps and map traffic data.

electric vehicle,electriccars,Electric Vehicle Home Compatibility,rainbow_vodka,"Hello everyone! If I should post this elsewhere please let me know, but I'm not sure where to start on this research.

I'm in the beginning phase of researching a new car to hopefully purchase in the next six months. I'm hoping to purchase an electric vehicle, but there are a few logistical challenges - the first one being that our house was built in the 1950s and has an old wiring system. My partner knows more about this than I do, but he is still clueless. He said that the wiring system we have is called ""two knot"" but when I google ""two knot wiring"" all that comes up is knob and tube. Does anyone know if this is the same thing?

My question here is whether or not our house's electric can handle an EV charger or if we will need to upgrade our electric first. If our home's electric can not handle an EV charger, how impractical would it be to purchase an electric car without having a home charger? For context we live on O'ahu in Hawaii. I have checked a few maps and I see that there are level 1, level 2, and DC fast chargers but I'm not sure what the difference really is. I'm assuming for faster charging I would want the DC fast charger, but would that charge a vehicle quickly enough to not need a home charger?

All advice is appreciated, thank you so much!

This will be our car around the town and short road (under 150 mile) road trips so range isnt an issue. We'll be charging this mostly at home as well.

The criteria I have are:

a) Under $50K preferably close to $40K. We don't qualify for the $7.5K Fed rebate

b) Good tech. Nice dash, nice stereo system, good safety features  
c) Sporty to drive. 0-60 in under 7 for sure.  
d) Some luxury. Leatherette seats, classy looking interior

Of course I will investigate the Iqonic 5/EV6 as Car and Driver rates them so highly. But what else?

To give you an idea of what I \*dont\* want I'll point to an VW ID.4. It's slow off the mark and the tech/dash makes it look East German. I own an VW (Tiguan) and love it, but that ID.4. was awful.

I guess a related question is what is the sweet spot for EV purchases when above it, the returns are diminishing.

(I don't want to deal with oil changes, gas stations, etc.. of a plug in hybrid)   My family shares one car, so we need something with some range (280 miles plus), and need a trunk big enough to fit a large stroller.  

My first thought is the Tesla Y as the range and price are both good, and it qualifies for the $7500 incentive.  I like that AWD is standard, and the tech in it seems really nice.  I hear a lot of negatives about the build quality however which makes me a bit nervous.

We test drove the Ioniq 5 which we liked a lot, but it doesn't qualify for the $7500, so it ends up being $7500 more than a Tesla.  Kia's comparable EV6 falls into the same category.

We are also looking at the Mustang, Kia EV9, Niro, Kona, MX-30, Chevy Blazer, Chevy Equinox, and the ID.4.  I was wondering if anyone else is going through the same situation and is Tesla still the way to go?  It seems like the best value (mostly due to $7500 off) to me after driving and looking at the prices and features.

EV,electriccars,"Alternative to the Bolt? After a Test Drive, I HATE the Headrests. Looking For a Prius-Esque EV Hatchback",trekkiegamer359,"I'm looking to buy my first EV, and am trying to figure out which one to choose.

A bit of basic info: I'm in the Midwest in the US. I have a budget of $20-$25K max, (preferably less), for newish car with less that 20-30k miles on it. I'm getting a charger installed.

I've driven priuses since 2005  and am looking for a second car. I want it to be similar in size, and a hatchback. I was previously recommended a bolt on here, but after test driving one, I HATE the headrests. They shove your head forward, and will give me a stiff neck in no time. So now I'm looking at other options.

I work from home and mainly just drive to stores once or twice a week. I live in a metro with a couple of freeways, so it needs to drive well on a freeway. We get some definitely cold days during winter , with normally at least a week or two around 10\* to -5\* F. So I need it to be ok in cold weather. I do drive to and from a city a couple of hours away a few times a year (there and back in the same day). There are are a ton of fast chargers both on the drive there, and at the other city, so I'm not too worried about it. I'm also keeping my prius, and will probably use that for most trips to the other city.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5, Hyundai Kona, Kia Soul, and Kia EV6 were also suggested. All of them are a bit more expensive than the Bolt. While I'm looking into them, I'm also wondering about the Nissan Leaf. Is it good? Is it less recommended just because it has less bells and whistles? Or is it not as dependable, safe, has a worse battery, or some other issue? What car(s) would you guys recommend?

My daughter will start driving soon and will inherit my current ride, a 2009 Ford Edge with a newly rebuilt transmission. I'm ready for a new ride and having a really hard time figuring out what to get, which has led me here.

My average daily drive is 10 to 40 miles round trip. Road trips or long drives would be done in my husband's hybrid,  so finding somewhere to charge isn'tan issue. I need an SUV as we have our own pottery business and I have to be able to move a lot of product in plastic totes in my car regularly.

Adding a charger at home would be easy as we already have a 220 outlet in our garage for our pottery kiln.

My questions are:
Can I charge outside only? I can't park in the garage due to the above-mentioned pottery.  I live in Fort Worth, TX so it's not like it rains often, but would this be a problem?

What to get? My new car budget is $50k. I'd love a Genesis, but they're out of reach unless I go used. Tesla is not an option. I'm really intrigued by the Volvo EX30 and probably like the look of it more than any of the other options, but didn't see Android Auto or ventilated seats (it gets hot here!) listed as features.

I've read good and bad things about the Hyundai Ioniq 5, but I really don't like the look of them... the Mustang Mach E looks okay? I honestly don't know what to look for and haven't been wowed by any. I wish Tesla wasn't... Tesla, ya know?
